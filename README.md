# Data-engineering-Pyspark-projects
The Flipkart Data Engineering project is focused on building a robust data pipeline that processes and transforms large datasets from Flipkart's e-commerce platform. The main goal is to efficiently handle and analyze data using PySpark within the Databricks environment, demonstrating key data engineering techniques to clean, transform, and prepare data for analysis.

Tech Stack
PySpark: Used for distributed data processing, allowing for efficient handling of large datasets.
Databricks: Provides an interactive environment for running PySpark jobs and collaborating on data engineering tasks.
Local File System/Databricks DBFS: Used for storing raw and processed data locally within the Databricks environment.
SQL: Utilized for querying and aggregating data to derive insights.
Project Architecture
Data Ingestion:

Data is ingested from various sources like transaction logs, product catalogs, and user interactions.
The data is stored locally within the Databricks File System (DBFS) or the local file system of the Databricks environment.
Data Cleaning and Transformation:

Data is cleaned using PySpark, addressing issues such as missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
Transformation of data includes filtering, aggregating, and joining multiple datasets to create a structured and optimized format for analysis.
Data Processing:

Batch processing is performed using PySpark within Databricks to handle large-scale data efficiently.
Complex transformations are applied to derive key insights, including sales trends, customer behavior analysis, and product performance metrics.
Data Storage:

Processed data is stored locally within the Databricks environment, making it accessible for further analysis.
Data is organized in a structured manner, using partitions to optimize performance for large datasets.
Data Analysis:

SQL queries are executed on the transformed data to generate reports and visualizations.
The final dataset is used to build dashboards and reports that provide insights into areas such as sales performance, customer segmentation, and inventory management.
